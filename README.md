- **🤖 ML-Based Purchase Prediction**
  - Predicts conversion volume using impressions, clicks, signups, and spend.
  - Utilizes a Linear Regression model in Python.

 We started with Linear Regression due to its interpretability and alignment with expected relationships in marketing funnels. It provided a solid baseline (R² ~0.71). Then we explored regularization (Ridge/Lasso) hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance generalizability.
 
  - **Model Performance:**
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE): **711** (predictions deviate by ≈ 26.7 purchases on average)
    - R² Score: **0.7077** (explains 71% of the variation in purchases)
    - Lasso Regression	0.7199	Best R² — and performs feature selection
    - Cross-validated R² (Lasso)	0.8285	Model is highly generalizable — strong predictive power
   
  Signups are the strongest predictor of purchases. Channels and strategies that optimize for more qualified signups will directly improve conversions. Spend and impressions are less useful once signup quality is accounted for.

- **📊 Channel Comparison & Optimization**
  - Visual insights to identify top-performing platforms.
  - Optimize ad spend using interactive Power BI dashboards.
